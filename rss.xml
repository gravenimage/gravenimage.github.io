Locked. Down.
</p>

<p>
With 2 young children, there's not much change.  But after 7 (???)
weeks, it <b><b>is</b></b> beginning to feel a little constricting.  And working
from home, I'm finding it more important than ever to get more
organised, in work and in home life. 
</p>

<p>
So, as a little experiment, I'm moving a lot of my life into org-mode,
and this is the outcome.  A blog might seem old-fashioned, but it
feels a little less self-indulgent than a snarky twitter feed or a
look-at-me Facebook post.  And as for Instagram etc - kids these days.
</p>

<p>
Harumph.
</p>

<p>
So, I'll try and blog something every 2 days.  It might be nothing, it
might be about programming, it might be about life in Norway (which
I'm slowly acclimatizing to).  We'll see.  No promises.
